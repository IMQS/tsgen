#20	Move most of the const declaration for 'enum' types to the config.go file
	and redefine the types in the TSProperties struct to make use of these
	types.
#19 Implement the REAL Mode to release HTTP requests according to the relative
	differences between absolute points in time generated to fit within the
	Duration (in seconds) defined in the config file
#18 Update the Type array to take capitalised strings as is the way most other
	config settings are defined in the config file
#17 Add Mode to the configuration file.  Mode determines the way in which
	the data set is released through the Output.

#16 Extend `Bias`, `Type`, `Freq` and `Amp` to arrays to support the compound
#15	Add Bias configuration item
#14 Implement a compound type signal that is built out of an array of Sin and 
	Cos types at this point in time

#13 Implement the HTTP POST support for single as well as batch HTTP requests
#12 Implement 'High' and 'Low' scaling factors for the Logic data type to
	scale the HIGH and LOW logical signal values
#11 Use the events and state to generate Logic signals that 
	change at random intervals throughout the time series distribution
	but only the amount of times specified
#10 Implement configuration properties to allow for the Logic data type
#9 	Implement a toggle switcher that flips between STATEs on each toggle event
#8 	Register toggle events on predetermined amount of samples
#7	Generate event nodes
#6	Implement quick sort utility since sort package does not support sorting 
	[]UInt64

#5	Add the basic moment measurement tool to the profiling package, use it to 
	measure the time it takes to generate an output
#4	Remove the verbose display of each data point generated.  Send to CSV
	output if data has to be evaluated or visualised.
#3. Add events to time series generation and return as structure that 
	contains relevant event information for exact point in series, this commit 
	DOESN'T make use of the event YET.	
#2. More elaborate comments in the packages.
#1.	Change package 'file' to 'out' since the possible destinations have been 
	updated to include queues, http requests etc.
