#1.	Change package 'file' to 'out' since the possible destinations have been 
	updated to include queues, http requests etc.
#2. More elaborate comments in the packages.
#3. Add events to time series generation and return as structure that 
	contains relevant event information for exact point in series, this commit 
	DOESN'T make use of the event YET.
#4	Remove the verbose display of each data point generated.  Send to CSV
	output if data has to be evaluated or visualised.
#5	Add the basic moment measurement tool to the profiling package, use it to 
	measure the time it takes to generate an output
