#16 Extend `Bias`, `Type`, `Freq` and `Amp` to arrays to support the compound
#15	Add Bias configuration item
#14 Implement a compound type signal that is built out of an array of Sin and 
	Cos types at this point in time

#13 Implement the HTTP POST support for single as well as batch HTTP requests
#12 Implement 'High' and 'Low' scaling factors for the Logic data type to
	scale the HIGH and LOW logical signal values
#11 Use the events and state to generate Logic signals that 
	change at random intervals throughout the time series distribution
	but only the amount of times specified
#10 Implement configuration properties to allow for the Logic data type
#9 	Implement a toggle switcher that flips between STATEs on each toggle event
#8 	Register toggle events on predetermined amount of samples
#7	Generate event nodes
#6	Implement quick sort utility since sort package does not support sorting 
	[]UInt64

#5	Add the basic moment measurement tool to the profiling package, use it to 
	measure the time it takes to generate an output
#4	Remove the verbose display of each data point generated.  Send to CSV
	output if data has to be evaluated or visualised.
#3. Add events to time series generation and return as structure that 
	contains relevant event information for exact point in series, this commit 
	DOESN'T make use of the event YET.	
#2. More elaborate comments in the packages.
#1.	Change package 'file' to 'out' since the possible destinations have been 
	updated to include queues, http requests etc.
